# gpu-screen-recorder-autosort

This is more of a "I am trying to learn bash scripting" project and I hope no one is going to use this.
However if you really want to use this for some reason then here is a basic guide:

1. clone this script
2. run it to perform a first-time setup
3. follow the instructions
4. run it after you save a replay with gpu-screen-recorder (I have it bound to a shortcut in KDE so the command I exec when I press my bind looks something like this: )

yeah idk this is really bad
